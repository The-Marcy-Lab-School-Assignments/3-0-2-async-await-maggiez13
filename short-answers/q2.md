# Question

This code snippet makes a fetch to get the first todo item from the JSON placeholder API. Or at least it tries to.

What is wrong with this code? 

Describe how async/await helps us avoid this mistake.

```js
fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1')
  .then(response => {
    if (!response.ok) throw new Error('Fetch failed!');
    response.json();
  })
  .then(json => console.log(json))
  .catch(err => console.log(err))
```

You can run this code of course, but try not to! Try to figure out the issue on your own.

# Answer
The problem in the code is that we are not returning `response.json()`. Since it is not returned, the promise chain is broken and it does not move forward to actually getting the data from json and completely stops. 

By using async/await, we would avoid this mistake as it would be awaiting for the result of the asynchronous calls, ensuring that each step completes before moving to the next. This makes the code more readable and less prone to errors.
