# Question
Using `async`/`await` over `.then`/`.catch` makes our code for handling promises much more readable. What are the ways in which `async`/`await` is more readable than `.then` and `.catch`?

# Answer

By using `async`/`await`, we
are writing asynchronous code in a synchronous manner, which makes the flow of the code execution to be easier to follow. 

Additionally, with `try`/`catch` blocks, error handling and debugging becomes more straight-forward. It will also be easier to implement loops and conditions which in turn allows us to avoid callback hell and write cleaner, more maintainable code compared to chaining promises with `.then`/`.catch`.
