# Question

Is this function safe? Why or why not?

```js
const getUser = async (userId) => {
  const url = `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/${userId}`;
  const response = await fetch(url);
  const users = await response.json();
  console.log(users)
  return users;
}
getUser(-1)
```

Again, running the code gives you the answer, so try to figure it out on your own first!

# Answer
This function is not safe as it lacks error handling for potential issues, such as network failures or invalid `userId` values. Without error handling, these issues can cause unhandled exceptions. Adding a `try`/`catch` block and checking `response.ok` ensures that the function handles errors, making it more reliable.
